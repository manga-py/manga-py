First of all, look at information at `Docs folder`_, to see general appointments about manga-py.
After, if you have defined a question, use the search engine at `GitHub Issues`_.
It will permit you to try to find if your question was already answered in the past.

If you have scoured all above paths, and yet needs support, please feel free to post your question at `GitHub Issues`_.
You can get some instructions about `posting one issue`_ to manga-py project.
But if you have a private issue (e.g. with personal data), you can `send a issue with personal data`_ properly.
